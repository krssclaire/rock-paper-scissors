# Rock Paper Scissors 
#### Intro
This project, by The Odin Project Foundations course (which instructions are at the following link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), features the use of JavaScript logic and basic DOM manipulation. 

#### Features
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in which the Player can play against the Computer.
The player is able to choose an option and also see the Computer's choices, plus a message is displayed every round to communicate the verdict of the round.
The game ends whenever either the player or the computer reaches 5 points. 
In this case the player must refresh the page to start a new game.
This game can be played on both computer and phone since the design uses CSS breakpoints.
