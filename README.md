# rock-paper-scissors


### Intro
This project, by The Odin Project Foundations course (which instructions are at the following link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), features the use of JavaScript logic and basic DOM manipulation.

### Features
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in which the Player can play against the Computer. The player is able to choose an option and also see the Computer's choices, plus a message is displayed every round to communicate the verdict of the round. The game ends whenever either the player or the computer reaches 5 points. In this case the player can refresh the page to start a new game. 

### Design
The design is responsive on the main devices such as mobile phone/tablet and desktop, as long as the device has a screen height bigger than 720px.
